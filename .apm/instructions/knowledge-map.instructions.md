## Where knowledge lives

| What | Where | When to use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Decisions + rationale | `.agentic/decisions/` (ADRs) | Before proposing any architectural change, grep here for prior art and supersessions |
| Non-obvious constraints | `.agentic/gotchas.md` | Read the entries for your area before changing it |
| Canonical code shapes | Exemplar paths listed in `.agentic/gotchas.md` | Copy the exemplar's shape for new code; never invent structure |
| Multi-session plans | `.agentic/specs/` | Active plans; move to `specs/completed/` when done |
