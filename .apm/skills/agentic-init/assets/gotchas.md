# Gotchas & exemplars

The ONLY prose knowledge file in this repo. Two kinds of entries, both cheap to
verify and dated. Add entries via `/gotcha`; re-verify via `/audit-docs`.
Rule of thumb: if the code can express it (types, lint rule, test), it does NOT
belong here. Only constraints invisible in the code itself.

**Size guardrail:** this file describes the *present*, not history (history lives in
`.agentic/decisions/`), so it should hover around equilibrium — roughly ≤40 entries.
Beyond that, do NOT split first: audit for entries that should be lint rules, ADRs,
or deletions (a bloated gotchas file almost always means the admission test lapsed).
Only if 40+ entries survive that audit, split by area into `.agentic/gotchas/<area>.md`
and turn this file into a one-line-per-area index.

Format — every entry MUST have `evidence:` (a repo path) and `verified:` (date):
