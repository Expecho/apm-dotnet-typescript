# .NET cyclomatic complexity

Read-only report — writes no files into the repo. Ranks methods by cyclomatic
complexity so hotspots surface before review. **OPTIONAL: lives in
`.agentic/optional-skills/`; onboarding copies it into `.claude/skills/` only when
the repo is .NET and carries a `cyclomatic_complexity_max` gate in
`.agentic/quality-gates.yaml`.** This is the measuring tool that `/execute-plan`
step 4 runs to produce the actual value for that gate. Requires the .NET SDK —
check `dotnet --version`.

## Step 1 — Resolve scope

- **Argument given** (path, project, or glob): analyze exactly that. Done.
- **No argument**: analyze the changed `.cs` files vs the base branch. Build the
  set from committed, staged, and unstaged changes; drop generated files
  (`*.g.cs`, `*.Designer.cs`) and anything under `bin/`, `obj/`, `node_modules/`:

  ```sh
  BASE="${BASE_BRANCH:-main}"                 # the branch this work merges into
  MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD "$BASE")
  { git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR "$MERGE_BASE"...HEAD
    git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR
    git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR --cached
  } | sort -u | grep -E '\.cs$' | grep -vE '\.(g|Designer)\.cs$' | grep -vE '(^|/)(bin|obj|node_modules)/'
  ```

  If the set is empty, say so and stop — there is nothing to measure.

## Step 2 — Pick the tool (Roslyn metrics, fall back to lizard)

Roslyn metrics run per project/solution (not per file), so measure the owning
project(s) and post-filter to the changed files from Step 1.

- **Roslyn code metrics (primary)** — the official Microsoft path. Emits every
  method's cyclomatic complexity regardless of any threshold:

  ```sh
  # Run the built-in Metrics MSBuild target against the project/solution that owns
  # the changed files. It writes an XML report (path from the /p:MetricsOutputFile
  # value you pass, or the target's default location).
  dotnet build <project-or-solution> /t:Metrics /p:MetricsOutputFile=<scratchpad>/metrics.xml
  ```

  Parse the XML: each `<Method>` carries `CyclomaticComplexity`; keep the ones in
  changed files. If the Metrics target is unavailable (older SDK / not wired up),
  the project can reference `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Metrics` — resolve the version
  from the feed, never from memory (hard rule 4) — or use the fallback below.
  Write the XML to the session scratchpad, never into the repo tree.

- **lizard (fallback)** — a dedicated cross-language CC tool, when the Metrics
  target isn't available or you want a no-MSBuild read:

  ```sh
  pip install --quiet lizard          # once; or pipx run lizard
  lizard <files>                      # per-method CCN, takes explicit paths
  ```

State which path you took and why (one line) so the numbers are interpretable.

## Step 3 — Report

- A table ranked worst-first: file · method/line · cyclomatic complexity.
- **Threshold** comes from config, never memory (hard rule 3). Read
  `gates.cyclomatic_complexity_max` from `.agentic/quality-gates.yaml`.
  - If it exists: flag every method at or over it, and state the source.
  - If it does not exist: report raw numbers, state plainly that no cyclomatic gate
    is configured, and offer to add one to `quality-gates.yaml` (do not invent a
    pass/fail line from a hardcoded number).

**Never score cyclomatic numbers against `cognitive_complexity_max`.** Cyclomatic and
cognitive complexity are different metrics with different numbers (one method can
measure 29 cyclomatic and 39 cognitive). If the repo gates on the cognitive one (e.g.
SonarAnalyzer.CSharp rule S3776 at build time), this skill is **informational only**,
never the row `/execute-plan` step 4 renders. Report raw cyclomatic numbers, say which
metric they are, and leave the gate to the build.
- Keep it to the report. Refactoring is a separate, explicit ask.
